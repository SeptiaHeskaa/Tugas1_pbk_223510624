      hi, this is the other side of me hahaha. <br>
To be honest, I'm not really interested in the world of coding, 
but thanks to the support of my colleagues, 
they were able to help me get to know more about the world of informatics. <br> 
I am very happy to have many friends who are smart and able to teach me things that I didn't know before. 
Thank you to my colleagues who have helped me until now!! xixi <br>
and also This is actually a CV that I just made for the first time in my life. <br>
So sorry if there are a lot of word errors or shortcomings in choosing the design, OK!! thankyouu and bye
